	<h1>11 - Scenes</h1>
	<p>
		Yooo wusup, in this lesson we'll be playing with scenes like pausing, resuming, removing, adding scenes.
		Have seen in game how each of them displays how much ammo, weapons, health, money the player has, where the enemy is, stats of vehicles, etc.
		We're gonna make something similar to that keeping them simple.	And we'll be pausing and resuming them too.

	<!-- keep a copy of text object when creating some text objects -->
	<!-- dont forget to turn on mouse visibility -->
	<!-- to avoid issues pause the dead scene too -->
