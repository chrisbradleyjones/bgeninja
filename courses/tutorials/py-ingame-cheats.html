	<h1>Cheats</h1>
	<p>
		In this tutorial, we're going to implement cheat codes inside our game project.<br>
		Without any further ado, let's get started.
	</p>
	<figure title="ngl this was one of my most favourite games of all time,&#010;I love playing this game so much and this tutorial was inspiered by this game lol">

	<h3>Keyboard</h3>
	<h5>Logic Bricks Setup</h5>
	<p>
		Open up the logic bricks, add an always sensor,
		a keyboard sensor which is going to record
		our keystrokes and a python controller having it's script type to
		<b>Module</b>. Create a new property, name it as <span class="mono">record</span>
		whose data type will be <b>boolean</b> and another property named as
		<span class="mono">cheats</span> whose type will be <b>string</b>.<br>
		Moving to the keyboard sensor we've just added, we need to record the keys we're
		pressing so enable <b>All Keys</b>. The <b>Log Toggle</b> field asks for a property
		which let's us to record the keystrokes, if the property is false we
		<u>can't</u> record our keystrokes,
		so go ahead select our property <span class="mono">record</span>
		in that field and set it True (just enable it lol). The <b>Target</b> field asks
		for a property with which we record our keystrokes, so select our
		<span class="mono">cheats</span> property in that field.<br>
	</p>

		If you run the game, you can that our keystrokes are being recorded.

	<h5>Python Setup</h5>
	<p>
		Create a new file, name it as <span class="mono">cheats.py</span>,
		define the necessary like below.
	</p>
	<pre><code>try:
    import Range # I'm using Range Engine
except:
    import bge as Range

cont = Range.logic.getCurrentController()
own = cont.owner

def main(cont):
    pass</code></pre>
    <p>
    	Now the <span class="mono">main</span> runs in a continuos loop, we need to check
    	our <u>cheat code</u>. Before that I'd like to create some code for our cheats.
    	<ul>
    		<li><u>nogravity</u> - sets the world gravity to 0</li>
    		<li><u>iamspeed</u> - player moves very fast</li>
    		<li><u>abigcube</u> - spawns a big cube</li>
    	</ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    	Here are some cheats, the first two cheats changes the default value. If
    	we type the same cheat again, we must be able to get it back to normal mode.<br>
    	Now to implementing it, we check the if any of the above cheats was typed
    	we trigger what must be triggered.
    </p>
    <pre><code>def main(cont):
    if "nogravity" in own["cheats"] and own.scene.gravity != 0:
        own.scene.gravity = (0,0,0)
    elif "nogravity" in own["cheats"] and own.scene.gravity == 0:
        own.scene.graivty = (0,0,-9.8)</code></pre>
